I'm doing [this](https://challenge.synacor.com/) in R. See [umber.Rmd](umber.Rmd) for progress on the most recent version of the code, [topaz.Rmd](topaz.Rmd) for the first two days' draft, and [the logs](/logs) for the most recent program iteration and also my error logs. See [arch-spec](materiel/arch-spec) for the original instructions.
